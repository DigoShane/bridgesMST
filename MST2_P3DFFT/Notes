This has been created to test Full Potential calculation performed without P3DFFT. The steps are
1. Remove P3DFFT from the linking.
2. Run it on Cu to see if everything runs fine.
   a. LSMS calcualtion works fine
   b. Facing some problem with KKR calculations.
      Got this to work with 4x4x4 k points for Brillouin Zone integration.
3. substitute in a 3n atom per unit cell calculation; also try 5n and 7n.
   Ans-> Didn't work, went down to 4x4x4 grid piint with -5.3 as the bottom of the valence band for a Graphite stacking.

4. If the above is succssful, then run on graphene.
